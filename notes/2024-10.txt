oops, didn't do one of these for a while. oh boy... it's too much to

thinking of applying for fulltime (or 4 day/week) jobs again. but also
taught my first flute student in ages today and enjoying being an educator.

* use big blocks when uploading textures. I hacked a magic cap in to work
  around my VRAM bugs months ago, but those VRAM bugs were fixed. this big
  block change fixed some subtle texture issues.
- i need APIs for setting ztest and atest methods. this won't be hard.
