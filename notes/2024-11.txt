oh man doing this regularly is hard apparently :D

here is a bit of a stopgap update to fill in since the previous entry, not all
of this was one day...

----------------------
ps2 game: SIDESCROLLER
----------------------
* fixed framebuffer sizes. interlaced signals still need a fullsize (eg 640*448)
  framebuffer! this is different to what i expected from how interlacing works.
  refraction says i should still double buffer to avoid tearing, so maybe
  supporting 480p DTV is worthwhile too.
+ added "WAD" files, which are inspired by the index that Kingdom Hearts uses
  for looking up the block that files reside in on a disk. I am using this
  over the network for now but i would like it to support disks too.
  i would like to promote this to the P2GARAGE library one day.
+ added IO apis to wrap WAD. maybe i actually don't want to load from a WAD
  sometimes, if i'm doing lots of hot reloading. but i suspect it will perform
  better over the network (ps2client) even though this is anecdotal for now
+ added a Linux build, so that i can run it in valgrind and find memory issues
* fixed many memory issues :D
+ added a binary level file format, and a tool to build that format from JSON.
  next step is exporting JSON from the LDTK editor and adapting the scripts to that.
! the game crashes on hardware (but not emulator or simulator) due to bad VADDR ~= 0x173700.
  this addr comes right from `callloc()` so i have no idea what is going on there, it feels
  like where calloc should be putting things :(

--------
simpleVM
--------
* finished the big register optimization refactor 
+ PC no longer a normal register, new Jump/Branch instructions.
  this reclaims a whole register, now named "D". 
+ build lang for WASM with compiler bindings
