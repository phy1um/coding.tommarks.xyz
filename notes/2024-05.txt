* unfix VIFCode alignment. underlying refactor is still good, but the VIF packet does not 
  start where I thought it did unless the DMA transfer _includes_ the DMATag
* do not DMA wait at the start of a frame, this was hanging
* correct QWC for DIRECT VIFCode, so we can now transfer data to GIF via VIF and render stuff!
! TODO: cleanup makefiles, they are annoying. change it to not rebuild Lua all the time!!!

* fixup positions of entities for new tilemap alignment
* move camera bounds to room settings, can be configured in scripts

+ add horizontal dashing when double tapping left/right
  - unsure how much to clamp/limit V speed
  - maybe this should be uncapped? just let people fly up
  - but that makes up dashing less useful
  - horizontal down dashing is _really_ cool though
  - only dash once in air, but reset on walljump
* player uses moving sprite when in air
! player maintains momentum when hitting head while dashing
* camera moves up and down
* tilemap no longer spawns at random (-128, -128) offset, put it at (0, 0)
- where do camera bounds live? should this be in a resource? then it would be
  easier to set with room scripts
* camera focuses ahead of where the player is facing by a small offset

* fix VIFCode alignment with DMATags, start after 8bytes instead of 16
! still no output to screen :(

* add walljump 
  - speed based on current veritical speed
  - more vspeed => less hspeed
  - but vspeed is clamped to a limited range, walljumps always have +ve vspeed
  - walljumps slamming you into the earth sucks
- unsure if dash/walljump should have fixed vspeed or be based on player state
  - maybe current system based on existing vspeed is too inconsistent?
- the player is accumulating a lot of state, but i guess that is expected..
