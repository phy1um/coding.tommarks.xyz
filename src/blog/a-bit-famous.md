## A Taste of Attention

Recently the Youtube Algorithm has smiled on me, and one of my
videos has been suggested to *over 2 million people*. This converted to 200,000 views
and over 10,000 watch hours. These numbers aren't life changing,
but it's been amazing to get my first taste of attention on the platform.

## How I Got Here 

I started making Youtube videos in 2014. I've never considered it a serious way to make money,
and I still don't consider it a serious way to make money. I enjoy talking about things I love
and I like the idea of making some side money from it one day.

My main content before 2021 was gaming focussed, mostly Quake and Arena FPS videos.
I'm very proud of some of these videos, but the most successful release flatlined at
8,000 views. I was extremely happy with this, but I didn't have enough views to become
a Youtube partner or begin to monetize videos. I didn't view myself as having enough of a
fanbase to bother with Patreon or other support platforms.

In mid-2021 I started a series of livestreams programming a Playstation 2 game, and uploading the
VODs to Youtube. I knew the content had some appeal, simply due to the novelty. Nobody
else had worked on a project like this. The views were ok, with some videos out-performing 
my average Quake videos for far less effort. The first video in the series continued to grow
in views, and coming into the last quarter of this year it comfortably became my best performing video ever. 
Across my other videos I was seeing increased viewer numbers, and slow but persistent growth.

## The Boom
In late November, for no discernible reason, The Algorithm decided my first Playstation 2
video was worth showing to people. Almost overnight I had 100,000 impressions and
converted ~10% of those into views. People were clicking on my first video, and many were clicking onto
at least one other video. I started getting a noticable uptick in subscribers, and
was recieving ~30,000+ views in a 48 hour sliding window for over a week.

Naturally this feels amazing. People are clicking on my content and I've had some great engagement
with subscriptions and/or comments.

## Reflection and Analysis
Most of my impressions and views are coming from one video. This is good, I love that
people are finding my series, but unfortunately this was *the first programming livestream
I had ever done*. The video has rough edges, and I don't present my ideas in the best way.
In 6 months of programming streams I've learned a lot about what I am doing, so it's sad
to see so much attention going to one of my roughest videos that doesn't represent my best work.

While I'm excited to say I have had 200,000 views, there is still a lot that could be better
about the numbers. The videos getting attention aren't my best work and they are not
generating the engagement I want.

My average view time is very low. For videos that are usually an hour or longer I am disappointed
by how few people are watching them through. I think this is something I need to be aware of
in future videos - if anything is rough or awkward at the start of a stream many people *will not*
tolerate it at all and click away from the video. I may need to edit videos and
have higher production value to hold my viewer's attention better.

As my impressions have continued to climb my clickthrough rate has dropped from >10% to ~6%. I don't know
how to interpret this, maybe it is natural to see the clickthrough rate drop as more people are suggested
the video. I feel like >10% in my first 6 months may have been a fluke/oddity and was never maintainable
without serious work. I'm not concerned about this drop, but I definitely want this number to be higher.
I felt that I had done better with thumbnails as time went on, but the data seems to fly in the face
of that. I need to experiment more to see if existing videos perform differently with different thumbnails
to work out which "style" is ideal.

In the future if I want to maintain my current viwer numbers or grow I need more videos getting attention. New
releases since I "blew up" are recieving more views than before, but nowhere near the first video
which has been widely recommended. I don't expect every video to be so widely suggested, but I
believe that I can produce more videos with the same kind of appeal in the future.

## Ambitions, Monetization
I now qualify to monetize my videos, but I worry that because
my engagement is quite poor putting ads on videos will drive engagement down. 
I do not think the monetary value of ads with my current viewership is worth
sacrificing engagement, especially because I expect the current pattern of views is 
temporary. While I will be creating a Patreon or other subscription/support option,
it isn't clear what I could expect to earn from this. I think it will be more beneficial for me to
invest in community, and giving people who want to support me special privileges to 
vote on and shape my content.

Overall I think I have hit something exciting that people are interested in. If I continue to grow,
and continue to refine the quality of my streams, I will hopefully have
new videos which get recommended by The Algorithm. My ambition is to build a community
of people interested in programming from around the world to share in my journey to build
interesting things. If there are people in that community who want to support me financially
that would be excellent, but at this point I am far more interested in community than money.

I need to start a Discord server so that people can chat and form the foundations of a community.
It would be good to have somewhere to engage with viewers outside of Youtube comments,
and seek feedback on ideas. A Discord server might also be a good place to trial video thumbnails
to see if my viewers have a better intuition about what will work than I do.
