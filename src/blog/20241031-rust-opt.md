## Optimizations

My first attempt involved strategies in 2 parts. First, attempting to store variables in registers and 
reusing those registers where possible. Also using registers as temporary results when performing binary
operation chains. The second strategy was a static pass to remove noop instructions (eg `AddImm C 0` which
add 0 to the C register) and noop instruction _pairs_ such as a sequential push and pop targeting the same 
reigster.

This was surprisingly challenging, there were many edge cases in register allocation that I had to consider.
Overall my strategy is dumb - within the context of a block, a reigster is never freed. If variable `x` is 
encountered first, it takes up a free reigster slot and does not give it up even if it would be more optimal
to put the variable `y` there instead.

After a lot of blood, sweat and tears I had my frist pass of an optimizing compiler complete and ready to benchmark.
This initial results looked good:

### Arrays in struct test program

```
global int mhead;

type Foo := struct {
    int size,
    struct {
        *int elems,
    } bar,
};

*int malloc(int n) {
    let out := mhead;    
    mhead := mhead + n;
    return out;
}

void main() {
    mhead := 0x1000;
    let Foo foo;
    foo.bar.elems := malloc(100);
    foo.bar.elems[20] := 0xff;
    return foo.bar.elems[20];
}
```

| Version | # instructions |
| --------|--------|
| No optimiations | 102 |
| Optimizations (excluding padding) | 86 |
| Optimizations (including padding) | 96 |
 
### String print test program

This is a more interesting program, so I expect even more savings!

```
global *char IO_OUT;

type string := *char;

int strlen(string s) {
  return *(s-2);
}

void print(string s) {
  let i := 0;
  let pp := strlen(s);
  while (i < pp) {
    *IO_OUT := s[i];
    i := i + 1;
  }
}

void println(*string s) {
  print(s);
  putch(0xa);
}

void putch(char c) {
  *IO_OUT := c; 
}

void main() {
    IO_OUT := 0xe000;
    let tt := "foo bar";
    let aa := "hello world!";
    println(tt);
    putch(strlen(tt) + '0');
    putch(0xa);
    println(aa);
    putch(strlen(aa) + '0');
}
```

| Version | # instructions |
| --------|--------|
| No optimiations | 236 |
| Optimizations (excluding padding) | 246 |
| Optimizations (including padding) | 276 |

Safe to say we have a slight problem :o
