## My Art Trip, 2022

In late July I was fortunate to have a week and a half between jobs, so I took the chance to escape the city.
I was pretty run down from 2.5 years of working through lockdowns and health issues, and all of my time off since 2020
had been to see family. I was really ready to do something for myself. I made my goal to be somewhere beautiful,
and to give myself space to be bored. I ended up staying near Lakes Entrance, which is one of the most
stunning areas I've ever seen.

I took a bunch of visual art gear with me - a few kinds of paper, pencils, oil pastels, pens and ink. I don't
have much experience as a visual artist, but I used to spend time in my uni breaks painting when I needed to
get away from computers. I took a laptop, but I deleted my projects from it so that I wasn't tempted to code.

I have no idea what I'm doing with oil pastels, I bought them on a whim, but I ended up doing my most interesting
work with them on this trip. I was glad I experimented, I ended up creating a few pictures that I'm happy with,
even if everything is still really rough. I definitely feel more confident in creating art with my spare time
at home now.

Here are a few of the works I created, in roughly chronological order:
