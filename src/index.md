## about

I'm a programmer/developer in Melbourne, Australia. I work as a Golang
enterprise dev by day, and hack on weird side projects by night. I'm a
budding Haskell enthusiast, and a Lisp appreciator, but not very
experienced writing code with either. Please tell me about your cool
Functional Programming projects!

I started programming at age 8. My first programming experiences were in
Game Maker, before I expanded into Java and Python. Video games drove my
interest in computers growing up, especially vibrant worlds found in
*Oddworld: Abe's Oddysee* and Playstation 2 classics like *Ratchet and
Clank* and *Jak and Daxter*. I obtained a Bachelor's Degree in Computer
Science in 2019, and have worked mostly with Java and Python, as well as
C, Golang and Javascript. I have also programmed in Lua, Groovy and some
Lisp diallects. I would love an excuse to improve my Haskell skills.

When I'm not programming I enjoy gaming. I occasionally compete in and
commentate Quake tournaments, but that [has its own
website.](https://gaming.tommarks.xyz) Rouguelites are my favourite
singleplayer games and Spelunky 2 keeps me coming back for more. I go
for regular walks with no goal or direction, but lots of stops to
observe wildlife. Australia is home to lots of interesting bugs, birds
and reptiles which keep my walks interesting. I love to cook, I
sometimes attempt to draw or paint, and I'm slowly improving at chess.

Before studying computer science I was a a performance major studying
classical flute at the University of Adelaide. I still love music and
try to practice most days. My main interests are baroque composers
(Bach, Telemann), although one of my favourite pieces is the Claude
Bolling *Suite for Flute and Jazz Piano Trio*. I try to sing and play
piano, and I used to play saxophone in highschool, but I haven't owned
a saxophone in years.

## website

This website is hand written Makrdown run through a simple static site
generator script. I wrote [a blog post about building
it](blog-hello-world.html) if you want to see behind the curtain. I like
simple sites with minimal JS that focus on text rather than being
complex apps. Webrings, RSS feeds and IRC are all important technologies
to me, and I hope that shows in how I build my website. RSS here is
still a work in progress!
