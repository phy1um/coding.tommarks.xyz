## about

I'm an artist, programmer and teacher in Melbourne, Australia. I used to work in
tech, but I've stepped away to focus on education and performing arts. I teach
mathematics, programming and music, mostly to kids after school. I play the
flute a lot, but dabble in other woodwinds, piano, singing and recently some
guitar. In tech, I work and teach in Golang, Python, Rust and C.

I originally went to uni studying classical music, then swapped to computer
science. I spent 10 years in tech working in government, banking and
eventually logistics. I love simple technology - weird personal websites with
RSS feeds, low power devices that punch above their weight and efficient
programs that don't waste my time. I want to learn more about functional
programming and Haskell, and my email inbox is always open for a FP chat.

Sometimes I livestream programming on Twitch or make Youtube videos about
technology. I want to start posting some music content, but that is a work in
progress.

## website

This website is hand written Markdown run through a simple static site
generator script. I wrote [a blog post about building
it](blog-hello-world.html) if you want to see behind the curtain. I like
simple sites with minimal JS that focus on text rather than being
complex apps. Webrings, RSS feeds and IRC are all important technologies
to me, and I hope that shows in how I build my website. RSS here is
still a work in progress!
