I teach programming online over Discord. Send me an email or message me on
Discord ([my server](https://discord.gg/yczY6j7Wy9)).

In the past I have taught:

- Basics of programming in Python, Golang or C
- Code review (in a variety of languages, just ask)
- Working through a small project, eg building and deploying a website

I charge $65 AUD per hour, but I will discount bulk lesson bookings. If you
can't afford this, send me a message anyway and we can chat about the price.
