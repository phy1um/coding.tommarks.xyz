## why

I am an experienced programmer with 5+ years of industry experience. I love 
to talk about code, and help people explore new technologies. I started
livestreaming to share my coding knowledge with the world in 2021, and have
been teaching several friends how to program.

I have worked in Python, Java, Golang and Javascript. I have experience
with Bash scripting and common Linux utilities. I have also written Rust,
Haskell, and some Lisp. I have a solid understanding of coding interviews,
having observed and conducted interviews and the recruiting process.

I can offer:

- Basic or advanced programming concepts in a language of your choice
- Complexity analysis/algorithms 
- Coding interview preparation (mock interview, whiteboarding, algorithms)
- Reviewing and discussing your code
- Project based learning (I provide you with a project that we work through together)
